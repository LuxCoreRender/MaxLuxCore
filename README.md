# MaxToLux
MaxToLux is the 3dsMax internal plugin to render directly inside 3dsmax using LuxCoreRenderer API. The plugin(s) is written in c++. MaxToLux is still under development and needs more work to be a complete renderer.

The original forum discussion about this topic can be found [here](https://forums.luxcorerender.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1010)

MaxToLux is written in C++, and it's integrated into the interface like most other renderer plugins and natively utilizes the LuxCore interface.
